# Update

An Apple engineer responded on the [developer forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/756414) and confirmed this is a known issue with visionOS 1, the issue has been fixed in visionOS 2. I've confirmed that this sample project works as expected on visionOS 2.

# Large Collision Issue Example

This repo is a small sample project showing off an issue being faces where large objects places far from the origin don't seem to respond to taps correctly.
